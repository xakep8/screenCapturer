# ScreenCapturer
This is simple C++ ScreenCapturer built for cross platform and is supposed to work on windows, linux and mac. This is part of my practice of C++ projects and seemed like cool thing to build in C++, plus can be converted to a node addon later just will have to integrate with NAPI wrapper to expose the functions, or use execa to execute the functions of the binary in Javascript, lets see how it goes.

P.S. I hope this works ;)
